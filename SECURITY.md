## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have discovered a vulnerability in our project, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us responsibly. Please avoid public disclosure of the issue until we've had a chance to address it.

**Do NOT create GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities**.

Instead, to ensure privacy and efficient communication, please email your findings directly to me at [joseph@verron.pro](mailto:joseph@verron.pro).

We will review your report and will communicate any updates or requests for additional information through the same channel. Your effort in helping us ensure the security of our project is greatly appreciated, and we will endeavour to acknowledge your report in a timely manner.
